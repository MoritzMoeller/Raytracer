Raytracer
================

This is a raytracer coded in Python which was created during my studies. It includes:

* Lighting (Mehrere Quellen m√∂glich)
* Reflections
* Shading
* Shadows


Anleitung
================
The following Python script instantiates and starts the raytracing:
* main.py

The main.py is responsible to create all objects and configurations needed by the raytracer. The default rendering is 500x500px with two light sources.


Screenshots

The following picture trace1920x1080.png shows the raytracing result in Full HD.
